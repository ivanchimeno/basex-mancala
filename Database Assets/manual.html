    <div id="manualText">
       Mancala is a turn-based board strategy game played by two players.The game board consists of 14 holes: 12 of them are regular ones where stones or beans are placed by the players counterclockwise,and 2 of these are "Kalahas" which also contain stones, but also make up the score for the player. A player chooses one of his six holes and takes all the stones inside it. The player then places one stone into each hole, including the Kalahas, counterclockwise until all the stones are gone. If the player reached his Kalaha, and there are still stones to place, the player spreads them into the holes of the opponnent. The goal of the game is to have as many stones as possible inside the Kalaha and place the least amount of stones inside the holes of the opponnent. If a player drops the last stone in his own hole, and the hole was previously empty, the player takes all stones from the opposite hole and places them into his Kalaha. A player can move all the stones from his side into his Kalaha, when the opponent doesn't have anymore stones to place.
